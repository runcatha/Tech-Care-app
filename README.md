# Overview

Upgrading devices from the primary purpose of surfing the internet to coding can feel intimidating to anyone trying to break into the tech industry. Tech Care is an application created to help aspiring programmers choose a laptop. We do this by comparing the specs and prices of the best laptops availiable in one place to ease the research process. Users are then encouraged to 'pay it forward' by becomming a member to add/edit/remove devices to keep up with the changes in technology.
